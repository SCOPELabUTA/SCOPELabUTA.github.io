### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cat" aria-hidden="true"></i> About SCOPE Labs
SCOPE Lab works on techniques for **S**howing **C**orrectness **O**f (all) **P**rogram **E**xecutions. We aims to develop foundational technologies for improving the reliability of software systems. A core theme of our research is to improve the feasibility of formal methods and reduce the effort to ensure software systems work correctly. 

We are part of the [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [The University of Texas at Arlington](https://www.uta.edu/) (UTA).

(Yes, our icon is [Allison](https://allisonius.github.io/)'s smiling cat because.... why not?)
